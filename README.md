python-w3act
==============

`python-w3act` is a Python package for handling interactions with the [w3act](https://github.com/ukwa/w3act/) service.

It encapsulates basic API operations, focussing on extracting data from W3ACT.

The w3act command is the main interface, but the library can be used from tasks.
